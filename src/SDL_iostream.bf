	/**
	 * Use this function to create a new SDL_IOStream structure for reading from
	 * and/or writing to a named file.
	 *
	 * The `mode` string is treated roughly the same as in a call to the C
	 * library's fopen(), even if SDL doesn't happen to use fopen() behind the
	 * scenes.
	 *
	 * Available `mode` strings:
	 *
	 * - "r": Open a file for reading. The file must exist.
	 * - "w": Create an empty file for writing. If a file with the same name
	 *   already exists its content is erased and the file is treated as a new
	 *   empty file.
	 * - "a": Append to a file. Writing operations append data at the end of the
	 *   file. The file is created if it does not exist.
	 * - "r+": Open a file for update both reading and writing. The file must
	 *   exist.
	 * - "w+": Create an empty file for both reading and writing. If a file with
	 *   the same name already exists its content is erased and the file is
	 *   treated as a new empty file.
	 * - "a+": Open a file for reading and appending. All writing operations are
	 *   performed at the end of the file, protecting the previous content to be
	 *   overwritten. You can reposition (fseek, rewind) the internal pointer to
	 *   anywhere in the file for reading, but writing operations will move it
	 *   back to the end of file. The file is created if it does not exist.
	 *
	 * **NOTE**: In order to open a file as a binary file, a "b" character has to
	 * be included in the `mode` string. This additional "b" character can either
	 * be appended at the end of the string (thus making the following compound
	 * modes: "rb", "wb", "ab", "r+b", "w+b", "a+b") or be inserted between the
	 * letter and the "+" sign for the mixed modes ("rb+", "wb+", "ab+").
	 * Additional characters may follow the sequence, although they should have no
	 * effect. For example, "t" is sometimes appended to make explicit the file is
	 * a text file.
	 *
	 * This function supports Unicode filenames, but they must be encoded in UTF-8
	 * format, regardless of the underlying operating system.
	 *
	 * In Android, SDL_IOFromFile() can be used to open content:// URIs. As a
	 * fallback, SDL_IOFromFile() will transparently open a matching filename in
	 * the app's `assets`.
	 *
	 * Closing the SDL_IOStream will close SDL's internal file handle.
	 *
	 * The following properties may be set at creation time by SDL:
	 *
	 * - `SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_WINDOWS_HANDLE_POINTER`: a pointer, that can be cast
	 *   to a win32 `HANDLE`, that this SDL_IOStream is using to access the
	 *   filesystem. If the program isn't running on Windows, or SDL used some
	 *   other method to access the filesystem, this property will not be set.
	 * - `SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_STDIO_FILE_POINTER`: a pointer, that can be cast to a
	 *   stdio `FILE *`, that this SDL_IOStream is using to access the filesystem.
	 *   If SDL used some other method to access the filesystem, this property
	 *   will not be set. PLEASE NOTE that if SDL is using a different C runtime
	 *   than your app, trying to use this pointer will almost certainly result in
	 *   a crash! This is mostly a problem on Windows; make sure you build SDL and
	 *   your app with the same compiler and settings to avoid it.
	 * - `SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_FILE_DESCRIPTOR_NUMBER`: a file descriptor that this
	 *   SDL_IOStream is using to access the filesystem.
	 * - `SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_ANDROID_AASSET_POINTER`: a pointer, that can be cast
	 *   to an Android NDK `AAsset *`, that this SDL_IOStream is using to access
	 *   the filesystem. If SDL used some other method to access the filesystem,
	 *   this property will not be set.
